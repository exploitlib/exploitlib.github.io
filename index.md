## Information

### C++

**Why use C++ for hacking?**

When dealing with corporate level data, most databases are written in C++ as performance is the biggest factor in account. 


**How might you find bugs in C++?**

C++ is a low-level langugage, that makes available utalization of many system processes which may not be protected by the software developers of the applications. Mastering C++ should always be the hackers first task as most bugs are obsecure and undevlopement implementation of the programming language.

### Exploits

**What is an exploit?**

An exploit is a code that takes advantage of a software vulnerability or security flaw. 

**Exploit Database**

Exploits are found using online databases and this C++ library focuses on exploits for Windows. Usually exploiting windows products grows in difficulty as the Windows version is newer.

Here is an example of an exploits database: [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/)

**What to do after finding a reasonable exploit?**

After finding a resonable exploit to work on, our toolkit comes in play as it simplifies the code needed for the vulnerability. For all of the features that the toolkit provides, look in the toolkits tab.

### Toolkit

**What does the toolkit provide?**

FTP and Subversion to retrieve large Source Code
Autoconf/PTB make files
CMake support 
Network IPC and logging
Database Access, CGI 
Data compression crypting and data serialization
Wrapping packages, XmlWrapp and JsonWrapp
Api support and Gui/Graphic


## Library

### Access
